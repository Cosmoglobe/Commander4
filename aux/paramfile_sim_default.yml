# There exists downsampled versions of above pointing file, for sparser pointing. Useful if running at lower nsides.
# The not-downsampled pointing contains 13.6 billion pointings. Make sure NTOD*down is smaller than this,
# but as Planck only covered the full sky about ~8 times during this, also try and make NTOD*down as close to 13.6 billion as possible.
# It might be a good idea to simply set NTOD to the entire length of your selected downgraded file.
